# Ninja++
Its a 2D sidescrollign platform game I made alone for a subject at college as a way to learn Object Oriented Programming, C++ and using external libraries. Also this was my first
really big programming project, in no way this project was finished and this is how I presented it and I have not touched the code ever since. It was enough for me to pass the
subject and as this was my first big project, I was happy with the results.

The game has really simple mechanics as it was supposed to be a 2 person project and as my professor said, I ended up with Despair Oriented Programming. This game is missing a lot
of details such as a HUD, proper collision handle for the player being hit and innumerable other details that I just did not have the time to finish. I ended up just doing most of
the main requirements to be able to get the biggest grade I could. This game only has 2 stages and a main boss and the end game screen is the same as of when you die. All in all,
it was just me trying to get the handle of how a working on a big project actually works and I can't say I'm proud of the job I've done, I can say it was the best I could do given
the circunstances.

You can find more details of the game on the PDF I delivered alongisde the game, unfortunately it's only available in Portuguese and I don't think there is use for me translating
it anyway.
